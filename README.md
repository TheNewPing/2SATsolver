# 2SATsolver

Lists K solutions of a 2 SAT instance, having a minimum Hamming distance between them.

## Usage

A usage example can be compiled with `nvcc src/main.cu -o bin/main`. I can then be used with `bin/main [test_file]`. Many test files can be found in the `test_data` directory.

## Instance generator

This program reads a 2 SAT instance from a text file, The file should contain one clause per line. 
Letters are represented by numbers from 0 to N, with the requirement that each number in this range must appear at least once. 
Negations are represented by prefixing the character "_".

In order to create an instance with those requirements, a program can be compiled with `nvcc 2cnf_generator/2cnf_generator.cu -o bin/gen` and called with `bin/gen`.
It will ask for the number of clauses, the maximum number of variables, and the name of the output.
An instance generated by this program is not guaranteed to be solvable, it only satisfies the above requirements.
