# 2SATsolver

Lists K solutions of a 2 SAT instance, having a minimum Hamming distance between them.

## Usage

A usage example can be compiled with `nvcc -Xcompiler -fopenmp -lgomp -Iinclude src/main.cu -o bin/main`. It can then be used with `bin/main [-c] <test_file> <number of solutions> <minimum hamming distance>`. Many test files can be found in the `test_data` directory. The `-c` flag is used to run the serial algorithm after the parallel one, then compare the execution times.

## Instance generator

This program reads a 2 SAT instance from a text file, The file should contain one clause per line. 
Letters are represented by numbers from 0 to N, with the requirement that each number in this range must appear at least once. 
Negations are represented by prefixing the character "_".

In order to create an instance with those requirements, a program can be compiled with `nvcc 2cnf_generator/2cnf_generator.cu -o bin/gen` and called with `bin/gen <number of formulas> <probability of new variable> <output filename>`.
An instance generated by this program is not guaranteed to be solvable, it only satisfies the above requirements.
